### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## whoami?

I am a computational social scientist :man_scientist: and a research software developer :man_technologist:. I am a PhD candidate in Political Science, a [D-Lab Data Science Fellow](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/people/jae-yeon-kim) and a previously Data Science Education Program Fellow at UC Berkeley. In addition, I am co-organizer of [the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in the San Francisco Bay Area](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2020/bay_area/) (BAY-SICSS).

I study the politics of identity and inequality in the US, Canada, and East Asia from the civil rights movement (using administrative, organizational, and newspaper data) to the present (using social media, survey, and experimental data).
