### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## whoami?

I am a computational social scientist, a research software developer, and a runner. I use data science to advance social science research on diversity and inclusion. Whether I write a paper, code, or run, I try to follow the UNIX philosophy: ["Doing One Thing, Well"](https://hackaday.com/2018/09/10/doing-one-thing-well-the-unix-philosophy/)
