Hello,

I am a computational social scientist, research software developer, and data science educator. When I do not write or code, I enjoy cooking and distance running. I am also an avid reader (a huge fan of Haruki Murakami, Michael Lewis, and Michael Pollan) and music enthusiast (blues, jazz, classical, and hip-hop).
