Hello, nerds :nerd_face:. 

I am a computational social scientist, research software developer, and data science educator. When I don't write or code, I enjoy being remarkably mediocre at running, cooking, martial arts, yoga, meditation, and among other things. My passion is finding patterns and building tools.

### Data tools :man_technologist:

#### For research 

- [`tidytweetjson`](https://github.com/jaeyk/tidytweetjson): R package for turning Tweet JSON files into a cleaned and wrangled dataset. The package takes 4 minutes to turn 2 million tweets into a tidy dataframe. 
- [`tidyethnicnews`](https://github.com/jaeyk/tidyethnicnews): R package for turning search results from the largest database on ethnic newspapers
published in the United States (“Ethnic NewsWatch”) into a cleaned and wrangled dataset. The package takes 12.34 seconds to turn 5,685 articles into a tidy dataframe.
- [`makereproducible`](https://github.com/jaeyk/makereproducible): R package for making a project computationally reproducible before sharing it.

#### For fun 

- [`TidyChaseBankStatements`](https://jaeyk.github.io/TidyChaseBankStatements/): R package for turning Chase Bank Statements into a tidy dataframe.
