### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## whoami?

I am a computational social scientist, a PhD candidate in Political Science and a D-Lab Data Science Fellow at UC Berkeley. I study political learning, organizing, and mobilization among marginalized populations by using computational methodologies, such as natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, and building an interconnected database. I also develop research software that make using text data in social science easier.
