### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## whoami?

I am a computational social scientist, a PhD candidate in Political Science and a D-Lab Data Science Fellow at UC Berkeley. I study the politics of identity and inequality in the US, Canada, and East Asia using applied statistics and data science. I also develop research software that help social scientists utilize unstructured text data with little technical background.
