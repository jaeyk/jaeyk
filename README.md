Hello, nerds :nerd_face:. 

I am a computational social scientist, research software developer, and data science educator. When I don't write or code, I enjoy being remarkably mediocre at running, cooking, martial arts, yoga, meditation, and among other things. My passion is finding patterns and building tools.
