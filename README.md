### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## whoami?

I am a computational social scientist :man_scientist: and a research software developer :man_technologist:.

I study the politics of identity and inequality in the US, Canada, and East Asia from the civil rights movement (using administrative, organizational, and newspaper data) to the present (using social media, survey, and experimental data). I have passion for changing ideas and building tools. I believe that these two go hand-in-hand.
